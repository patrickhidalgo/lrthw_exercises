Questions:
> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

Reading and writing, attention to detail and spotting differences.

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading and writing - looking at code, comprehending code and typing code.
Attention to detail - paying attention to all of the small nuances in writing code.  Luckily if the details are wrong, the code will probably not work.
Spotting differences - looking at two pieces of code and not only visually seeing the differences, but understanding what those differences mean.

> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

Because typing out exercises, answers and code helps the learning process.  Mistakes will happen and editing mistakes helps learning.
