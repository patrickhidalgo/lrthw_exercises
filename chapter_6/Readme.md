* Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.

> 1 Line 15, the creation of variable y.
> 2 Line 24, the second puts of x.
> 3 Line 27, the second puts of y.
> 4 Line 45, the concatenation of w and e.

* Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.

> The x variable has an integer in it, not a string.
> The joke_evaluation variable has a true/false value in it, not a string.


* Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.

> The + is a concatenation command which combines the two strings.

* What happens when you change the strings to use ' (single-quote) instead of " (double-quote)? Do they still work? Try to guess why.

> As long as you are only changing strings that are not interpolating, everything should work just fine.
  The strings that perform interpolation cannot be ' because interpolation cannot be performed with '.

* Do you like string interpolation or format strings?  Why?

> I prefer string interpolation just because it seems more straight forward to understand.
