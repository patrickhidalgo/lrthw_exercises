1 .I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?

>In this specific example it is not necessary because all of the calculations and answers
happen to be integers.  The output does not change.

2. Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. It's just a number with a decimal point, and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.

> OK

3. Write comments above each of the variable assignments.

> See code

4. Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that it's making names for things.

> OK

5. Remember that _ is an underscore character.

> OK

6. Try running ruby from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before and use variable names to do your calculations. Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
